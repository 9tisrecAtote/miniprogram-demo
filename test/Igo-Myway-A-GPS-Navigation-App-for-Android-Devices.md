## What is Igo Myway?
 
Igo Myway is a GPS navigation app that was developed by NNG, a Hungarian company that specializes in navigation software. It is based on the Igo Primo platform, which is one of the most popular navigation solutions in the world. Igo Myway has been customized for Android devices, and it can run on different screen resolutions, such as 800x480, 1024x600, and 1280x720[^1^] [^2^]. It also works offline, which means you don't need an internet connection to use it.
 
Igo Myway provides high-quality maps that cover various regions, such as Europe, North America, South America, Asia, Africa, Australia, and New Zealand[^2^]. The maps are updated regularly and can be downloaded from the official website or from other sources online. You can also add your own points of interest (POIs), speed cameras, and other custom content to the maps.
 
Igo Myway also offers accurate routing and voice guidance for different modes of transportation, such as car, truck, bike, or pedestrian[^1^]. It can calculate the best route based on your preferences, such as shortest distance, fastest time, toll roads, or fuel consumption. It can also avoid traffic jams, road closures, or other obstacles by using real-time traffic information (if available). It can also warn you about speed limits, speed cameras, sharp curves, or other hazards along the way.
